this is *** NOT *** oryginal Path library, used for
finding routes thorught terrain!
it has been modyfied to relfex MUCH simpler operations
performed by robot - moving in terrain having (almost)
only local information on what is arround (from a current
perspective). no long-term object identyfication and
tracking is performed.
